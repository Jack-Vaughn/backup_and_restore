# Backup and Restore for Mac OS

# This was written in Swift 1 back when it was just called Swift. It needs to be completely written in a newer version of Swift in order to run on newer machines.

This was designed as an in-house help desk application, to quickly backup the current user's important files to an external drive. This allowed the machine to quickly be reimaged and the user profile restored.
